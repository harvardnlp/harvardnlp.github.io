        Harvard NLP studies machine learning methods for processing
        and generating human language. As a group, we are interested in 
        mathematical models of sequence generation, the challenges of 
        artificial intelligence grounded in human language, and the
        exploration of linguistic structure with statistical and neural tools.

        Our group's <a class="inline" href="/papers">research
        publications</a> and <a class="inline"
        href="/code">open-source projects</a> span all aspects of natural 
        language processing, including foundational work in computational 
        linguistics, machine learning for human-like language understanding, and the 
        development of tools and methodologies that advance both theoretical 
        and applied aspects of NLP.
